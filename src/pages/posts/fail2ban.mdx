## Install Fail2Ban package
Install Fail2Ban package to protect server from brute-force attacks. 

```
sudo apt-get install fail2ban
```

## Fail2Ban configuration for Proxmox

Create, if does not exist, the file jail.local (/etc/fail2ban/jail.local).
The following configuration works, unchanged, for Proxmox 6.x.
Add the following string to the end of this file /etc/fail2ban/jail.local :
```
[proxmox]
enabled = true
port = https,http,8006
filter = proxmox
logpath = /var/log/daemon.log
maxretry = 3
# 1 hour
bantime = 3600
```
Create the file /etc/fail2ban/filter.d/proxmox.conf :

```
[Definition]
failregex = pvedaemon\[.*authentication failure; rhost=<HOST> user=.* msg=.*
ignoreregex =
```

Restart Fail2Ban to make sure that the configuration changes takes affect.

```
systemctl restart fail2ban
```

## Test Fail2Ban
You can test your configuration trying to GUI login with a wrong password or user, and then issue the command:

```fail2ban-regex /var/log/daemon.log /etc/fail2ban/filter.d/proxmox.conf```
You should have at least a "Failregex: 1 total" at the top of the "Results" section (and "1 matched" at the bottom)
