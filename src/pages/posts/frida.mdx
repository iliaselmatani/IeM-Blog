## Using Frida to bypass certificate pinning
Often the TLS negotation fails for Android applications when you try to intercept the HTTP(S) traffic. A network capture trace can give you a good indication of certificate pinning is in place. 
Frida makes it possible to manipulate the application in runtime, very helpful when trying to bypass SSL pinning.

## Tools requirements
  - Python3
  - Objection
  - Frida
  - Android Studio

## Tools installation procedure
  - Step 1: Download latest version of python3 and install it. Make sure to enable path environment set tab as well.
  - Step 2: Install Objection using pip3. (Command: pip3 install objection)
    Note: Frida is a pre-requisite for objection, hence frida will get installed automatically.
  - Step 3: Download and install latest version of Android studio (https://developer.android.com/studio).
  - Step 4: Download any Android images (above 7.0) for the emulator.

### Injection script
Download the injection script from below which will be pushed into the device for injecting into the target application.
